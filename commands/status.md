# /status Command

Display a comprehensive snapshot of the current workflow state for quick orientation.

## Usage

```
/status                    # Show full workflow status
```

## What It Shows

- **Workflow Phase**: Current phase (idle, brainstorming, backlog-ready, etc.) and whether Write/Edit is allowed
- **Git Context**: Current branch, modified/untracked files, ahead/behind remote
- **Backlog Progress**: Active backlog path, completion percentage, recent and upcoming tasks
- **Skip Mode**: Whether workflow enforcement is bypassed

Use the **status** skill for the full status display.
