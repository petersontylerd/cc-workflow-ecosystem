# /brainstorm Command

Start a collaborative exploration of requirements and design.

**Note**: This command works best when invoked in plan mode (shift+tab twice). Claude Code will automatically use its built-in Explore and Plan agents for efficient codebase research.

## Usage

```
/brainstorm user authentication
/brainstorm add dark mode toggle
/brainstorm refactor the payment system
```

Use the **brainstorming** skill for the full exploration and design process.
